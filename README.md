This is a modification of the original WiiXplorer made by Dimok789, with a modification from FIX94 for adding support for use Wii U Pro Controllers.

It does not build with devkitPPC r45, and I have no plans on fixing it. I'm just creating this repo for archival purposes.

Credits:
* Dimok789 (and others) for writing [WiiXplorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wiixplorer/)
* FIX94 for writing [libwupc](http://github.com/FIX94/libwupc), which gave us the ability to use the WUPC with Wii Homebrews, and also for modify WiiXplorer for have Wii U Pro Controller support.

If you redistribute or modify this software, give credits to Dimok and FIX, not me.
