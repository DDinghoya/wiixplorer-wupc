This is a modification of the original WiiXplorer made by Dimok789, with a modification from FIX94 for adding support for use Wii U Pro Controllers, and a modification by Cyan for able to use drives with UStealth, on the Wii U.
This was compiled using [my modified libFAT](https://github.com/saulfabregwiivc/libfat/releases/tag/v1.1.5-other-vers-UStealth) for allow UStealth in selected homebrew apps.

It does not build with devkitPPC r45, and I have no plans on fixing it. I'm just creating this repo for archival purposes.

Credits:
* Dimok789 (and others) for writing [WiiXplorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wiixplorer/)
* FIX94 for writing [libwupc](http://github.com/FIX94/libwupc), which gave us the ability to use the WUPC with Wii Homebrews, and also for modify WiiXplorer for have Wii U Pro Controller support.
* Maxternal for the UStealth support on his custom libFAT, and Extrems for improving it in [his custom libFAT](http://github.com/extremscorner/libfat).
* Cyan (from GBAtemp) for modifying WiiXplorer for have UStealth support for Wii U. More info here: https://gbatemp.net/posts/5045390

If you redistribute or modify this software, give credits to Dimok, FIX94 and Cyan, and me (saulfabreg) for recompiling it with the old toolchain stuff.
